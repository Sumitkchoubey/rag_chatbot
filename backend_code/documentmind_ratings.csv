5,Tell me about detail Leave Policy per year,"Hey there! I'd be happy to help you understand the leave policy per year based on the provided context.

Answer:
According to the document, an employee is entitled to a total of 18 leaves in a year. This includes:

* Six (6) sick leaves
* Six (6) earned leaves (on pro-rata basis)
* Twelve (12) wellness leaves (on pro-rata basis)

The policy also specifies that an employee can avail minimum half (1/2) day sick leave at one time and maximum up to 2 days without producing a medical certificate. For earned leaves, an employee can take up to 3 days with short notice if it's greater than 3 days, otherwise, they need to apply at least 3 weeks in advance.

Additionally, the policy states that wellness leaves can be taken in units of half a day and maximum up to 2 days only. It also cannot be combined with any other leave types including Week offs and Mandatory leaves.

Confidence Score: 9/10 – The context provides clear information about the different types of leaves an employee is entitled to, as well as their frequency and eligibility criteria. However, it does not specify when or how the benefit value changes (amount or eligibility criteria), which is why I've given a confidence score of 9 out of 10.
